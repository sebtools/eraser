	<h1>Eraser Controller</h1>

	<p>Eraser Controller is a <a href="https://stimulus.hotwired.dev/">Stimulus</a> controller for clearing out hidden form fields. This does *not* empty out fields of type="hidden", but rather other form fields that are hidden by either CSS or the "hidden" HTML attribute.</p>

	<p>It can either clear fields as they are hidden or when the form is submitted.</p>

	<p>The controller will define hidden fields as any field that has a "hidden" attribute of true or that has a "display" style of "none" or a "visibility" of "hidden". It does not define hidden based on the location of the element.</p>

	<h2>Attributes</h2>
